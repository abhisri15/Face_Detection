# Face Detection using MediaPipe

This project demonstrates face detection using the MediaPipe library in Python. It processes a video input and detects faces, drawing bounding boxes and confidence scores around each detected face.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe (`mediapipe`)

You can install them using the following commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
pip install mediapipe
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-detection-mediapipe.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd face-detection-mediapipe
```

3. Run the Python script:
```bash
python face_detection.py

```

## About the Code
The provided Python script face_detection.py reads frames from a video file, performs face detection using MediaPipe's FaceDetection module, and displays the processed frames with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
